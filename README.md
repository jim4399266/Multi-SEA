# Multi-SEA: Multi-stage Semantic Enhancement and Aggregation for Image-Text Retrieval

## Introduction
We propose a Multi-stage Semantic Enhancement and Aggregation framework (**Multi-SEA**) with novel networks and training schemes. Multi-SEA first designs a fusion module with agent attention and gating mechanism. It enhances uni-modal information and aggregates fine-grained cross-modal information by involving different stages. Multi-SEA then introduces a three-stage scheme to integrate the two structures mentioned above together. Eventually, Multi-SEA utilizes a negative sample queue and hierarchical scheme to facilitate robust contrastive learning and promote expressive capabilities from implicit information. Experimental results demonstrate that Multi-SEA outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes with a large margin.
